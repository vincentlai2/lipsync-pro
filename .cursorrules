# Project: Next.js Application

## General

- This is a Next.js TypeScript application with App Router.
- Use React for components development, prefer to use functional components.
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling.

- Use sonner for toast notifications.
- Use Zustand for global state management.
- Component names are in camel-case.

## File Structure

- app/: Next.js App Router pages and API routes
  - global.css: global styles
- components/: React components
  - ui/: **Shadcn UI components and their wrappers**
- public/: Static assets
- lib/: Custom libraries and functions
- .env.local: Local environment variables (not committed to version control, and cannot be read by Cursor or most IDE/AI tools)

## Coding Conventions

- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow React best practices and hooks
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS and Shadcn UI
- Maintain a consistent internationalization structure
- Keep components modular and reusable
- Use proper type definitions for components and data

## File Management

- **All file deletion operations must be confirmed by the user before execution**
- Avoid deleting files unless absolutely necessary
- When file deletion is required, clearly explain the reason and get explicit user approval
- Prefer modifying existing files over deleting and recreating them
